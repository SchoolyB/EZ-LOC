# EZ-LOC

A simple CLOC (Count Lines of Code) implementation using the [EZ programming language](https://github.com/SchoolyB/EZ).

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.23+
- The EZ interpreter: [Download here](https://schoolyb.github.io/EZ-Language-Webapp/downloads/) and add to your PATH
- A directory in the project called `test_dir` with files in it

**NOTE:** Currently the program does not accept OS arguments. Once I get around to it, it will.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SchoolyB/EZ-LOC.git
cd EZ-LOC
```
